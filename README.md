## Netflix Clone App
This is a Netflix clone application.

While developing the application, I utilized Xcode with the UIKit framework in Swift programming language. For the movie database, I integrated the MovieDB API service. To display movie trailers, I integrated the YouTube Google API service. The software architecture employed is MVVM. The development process involved coding without using storyboards; everything was developed programmatically. With this application, users can explore current movies, watch their trailers, and perform movie searches.
